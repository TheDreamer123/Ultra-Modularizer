# Ultra Modularizer
**This is a simple, one file, C application that takes a file in, creates a folder corresponding to that file, inside that folder, creates x new files, each containing a single non-empty line from the original file and then deletes the original.**

## How reliable is this?
**As reliable as a joke made in one hour can be.**

## Why?
**Because it's funny.**

## Can I download the application or do I have to compile it myself?
**If you head over to [releases](https://github.com/TheDreamer123/Ultra-Modularizer/releases/tag/windows-release), you can get an already compiled version of the program.**

**If you'd rather compile it yourself, well... I assume you already know how. Just make sure when compiled, it uses C11 (`-std=c11` on gcc).**

## Does it require any libraries?
**No, it does not.**

## Does it work on X operating system?
**I'm not sure, it's only been tested on Windows 10 and only been compiled on Windows 10.**

## What can I do with the code?
**Anything that fits in the MIT license's permissions.**

# How do I use it?
**Easy! Open your terminal and type the following:**

**`path/to/UltraModulizer.exe path/to/file/to.separate`**

**A folder with a similar name to the file you chose should be created in the same folder as that same file.**
